# Peace
Peace is a project to combine the learning of Python and Github and my passion for board games and history. Peace is an idea for a board game where players take the role of diplomats in Versailles in the aftermath of WWI

# The Game Rules
The game is split into a number of rounds. A round is made of a debate phase and a crisis phase.
during the debate phase players will flip a number of debate cards.
All debate cards will refer to a historical topic of discussion at Versailles but simplified to either for or against. 
Each country may either benefit or suffer from the result of the debate. 
All debates must be resolved through majority decision and expending of a number of resources.
Players take it in turns to vote either for or against a debate and add resources to a debate or crisis.
Players may not change their mind until it is their turn again. 
Once all debates are resolved there will be a crisis phase where one crisis card will be flipped.
The players only have one turn each to resolve a crisis. 
To resolve a crisis the collective group of players must commit a specified number of resouces
If unsuccessful all players will lose resources.
If any player ends a turn with 0 of any resource then all players lose.
If the players complete all rounds then the player with the highest number of resources is the winner. 
Players may not exchange resources, but they may make non-binding promises about future voting.

# The Code
I am really just starting my journey into coding, having completed a couple of online courses and I am currently engaged in a Python bootcamp. 
By writing the game digitally I hope to put into practice as many of the things I have learnt as possible. This will likely mean that some of what I write will become obsolete as I learn to be more efficient and practical. This, in turn, means I am probably not using Github in the correct manner, committing changes to the internet that I know are incomplete or obsolete, but doing so I think will provide useful experience using the system.
I expect that I will not be able to write something that fully functions, at least to begin with and perhaps ever. It is the practice that is the important part of this project.
